# Project Skill: PRISMA Review Methodology

**Objective:** To guide the systematic identification, screening, and synthesis of literature according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Use this skill when tasked with conducting a systematic or scoping review.

## PRISMA Workflow Checklist

Follow these steps sequentially. Do not proceed to the next phase until the current one is complete and verified.

### **Phase 1: Identification**

- [ ] **Define Search String:** Formulate a comprehensive search string using keywords, boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), and truncation adapted for each database.
- [ ] **Select Databases:** Identify relevant academic and grey literature databases (e.g., PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science).
- [ ] **Execute Search:** Run the search string across all selected databases.
- [ ] **Export Results:** Export all identified records into a reference management tool (e.g., Zotero, EndNote).
- [ ] **Remove Duplicates:** Use the reference manager to automatically and manually deduplicate the records.

**Output:** A single file (`.ris` or `.bib`) containing all unique records.

### **Phase 2: Screening**

- [ ] **Title and Abstract Screening:** Screen each record against the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Exclude irrelevant studies.
- [ ] **Retrieve Full Texts:** Obtain the full-text articles for all records that pass the initial screening.

**Output:** A list of article IDs that have passed the title/abstract screening.

### **Phase 3: Eligibility & Inclusion**

- [ ] **Full-Text Review:** Assess the full text of each remaining article against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Document the primary reason for excluding any article.
- [ ] **Final Selection:** Compile the final list of studies to be included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis.

**Output:** A final list of included study IDs and a corresponding file documenting reasons for exclusion.

---

### **Phase 4: Synthesis**

- [ ] **Data Extraction:** Extract relevant data points from the included studies using a standardized data extraction form.
- [ ] **Qualitative Synthesis:** Summarize the findings from the included studies narratively.
- [ ] **Quantitative Synthesis (Meta-analysis):** If applicable, perform statistical analysis to combine results.
